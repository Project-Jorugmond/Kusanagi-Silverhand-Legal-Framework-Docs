# Legal DAO
The idea here is to implement a DAO for Project Jorugmond

https://github.com/proftomwbell/Ulex is a good template for the legal system, modified to be modern, rights protecting, ai driven, forward thinking, plain language, and blockchain native.

The idea is to provide a modern system for governance which could act as a baseline for a network native nation state as a fail over or fallback. Nation states fail, and preventing a USSR or Yugoslavia style fail is kinda important, we have the technology to fix the problems and save humanity, the question is, will we?
