## Human Rights Compliance & Network Lockout

All participating communities in the **Kusanagi Silverhand Framework** must comply with a minimal set of **fundamental human rights**. These rights form the base layer of the federated digital nation network.

### Compliance Principle
- Each nation/community is sovereign in its governance.  
- To join the federation and access shared infrastructure (identity, trade, communication, interoperability), compliance with the base human rights layer is required.  
- Rights include: dignity, equality, freedom of expression, freedom from discrimination, and protection from abuse.  

### Lockout Mechanism
- If a community violates the base human rights requirements, it is **automatically suspended** from the federation.  
- Lockout removes access to:
  - Federated identity systems  
  - Interoperable economic exchange  
  - Cross-network governance participation  
- Local governance continues unaffected, but the community becomes **isolated** until compliance is restored.  

### Restoration
- A locked-out community may rejoin the federation after demonstrating compliance with the base human rights layer.  
- Verification is performed via transparent review and consensus mechanisms within the federation.  

This ensures **freedom of self-governance** while safeguarding **universal rights** and protecting citizens from systemic abuse.

### Example Scenario: Lockout in Action

1. **Violation Detected**  
   - Nation A passes a law restricting citizenship based on ethnicity.  
   - This violates the federation’s base human rights principle of equality.  

2. **Automatic Lockout**  
   - Nation A is flagged and suspended from the federated network.  
   - Their citizens lose access to:  
     - Federated digital ID recognition  
     - Cross-nation trade and economy  
     - Shared governance channels  

3. **Continued Local Operation**  
   - Nation A can still govern itself locally.  
   - However, it becomes **isolated** and cannot interact with the federation until it reforms.  

4. **Restoration**  
   - Nation A repeals the discriminatory law.  
   - A compliance review confirms the reform.  
   - Nation A’s access is restored, and its citizens regain full participation in the network.  

This model enforces accountability without coercion: **no rights, no federation.**


## Multi-Citizenship & Exit Rights

The **Kusanagi Silverhand Framework** supports **multi-citizenship**, allowing individuals to belong to more than one digital nation at a time. This reflects the principle that identity is not bound to a single state.

### Core Principles
- **Multi-Citizenship**  
  - Citizens may freely hold membership in multiple nations within the federation.  
  - Rights and obligations are cumulative but cannot override the federation’s human rights base layer.  

- **Exit Rights**  
  - Any citizen may **leave a nation at will** if that nation becomes non-compliant with human rights.  
  - Upon exit, citizens may retain federation access through their other citizenships or by registering as **independent citizens** until they join another compliant nation.  
  - This ensures individuals are never trapped in an abusive or isolated system.

### Anti-Exploitation Safeguards
- Citizens **cannot rapidly switch nations** to shield themselves or their communities from accountability.  
- **Cooldown periods** or **compliance checks** prevent malicious actors from using exit/re-entry as a loophole.  
- Federation mechanisms ensure that switching citizenship is a tool for **protection of rights**, not a method for **violating them**.

### Example Scenario
1. Nation B begins censoring free speech in violation of human rights.  
2. Citizens of Nation B choose to exit and retain federation access through their secondary citizenships in Nations C and D.  
3. Nation B is locked out of the federation.  
4. Former citizens of Nation B are unaffected, since their rights are preserved by exit.  
5. If Nation B reforms and regains compliance, its citizens may return without penalty.  

This design guarantees **freedom of association** while maintaining **systemic integrity** and preventing abuse of the federation model.
