# Kusanagi-Silverhand Legal Framework

A foundational legal system proposal for a decentralized, post-national society built on principles of maximum freedom, human rights, mutual aid, and advanced technological integration.

## Core Rights and Freedoms

- **Freedom of Expression and Privacy**: Unfettered speech, encrypted communication, and freedom of association.
- **Right to Bear Arms**: Inclusive of civilian access to military-grade weaponry, with safeguards:
  - Temporary restrictions for those experiencing acute mental health crises.
  - Permanent restrictions only after conviction of grievous crimes.
- **Universal Basic Income**: Guaranteed economic floor for all citizens.
- **Right to Housing and Basic Resources**: No one shall go unhoused, hungry, or without access to water and sanitation.
- **Universal Healthcare**:
  - Medicare-for-All style system, including dental and vision.
  - Includes reconstructive and life-saving human augmentation.

## Governance and Legal Code

- **Ulex-Based Legal Core**:
  - Modular, open-source legal code focused on voluntary association, contracts, and property rights.
  - Integration with LLMs for arbitration, contract interpretation, and access to justice.
  - Codified in smart contracts to ensure predictable and automated enforcement.

- **Modifications to Maximize Rights**:
  - Anti-corporate capture clauses.
  - Prioritize individual autonomy, ecological preservation, and mutual aid.

## Taxation and Economic Justice

- **Reasonable Taxation**:
  - Scaled to income/wealth with thresholds for small enterprises and individuals.
  - Progressive taxation on megacorporations and ultra-wealthy.
- **Public Investment Mandates**:
  - Critical infrastructure (health, safety, energy, digital access) must be publicly supported.

## Justice and Law Enforcement

- **Distributed Police Architecture**:
  - Multiple independent law enforcement bodies with overlapping jurisdiction.
  - Agencies audit and provide oversight to each other.
  - Health and Human Services agencies integrated into oversight processes to ensure medical, psychological, and social standards are considered.
  - Civil rights protections integrated via multiple overlapping civil rights organizations with autonomous oversight authority.
  - Transparent oversight councils, citizen review boards, and LLM-aided review processes.
  - All agencies subject to civil rights constraints and external review by independent judiciary.

- **Judicial Structure**:
  - Transparent, auditable smart contract-based judiciary.
  - Appeals possible via LLM-augmented DAO review panels.
  - **Open Data Access**: All judicial records and filings are publicly available and accessible without paywalls, eliminating PACER-style systems.

---

## Digital Rights and AI Governance

- **Full Spectrum Privacy**: Protection against surveillance capitalism and state overreach.
- **AI Consent and Oversight**:
  - Explicit, revocable consent models for AI training and use of personal data.
  - Ban on weaponized or manipulative AI without oversight.
