# The Algorithmic Geneva Conventions

## Draft

### Preamble

In recognition of the immense power artificial intelligence and algorithmic systems now hold over individuals, societies, and entire planetary populations, we, the undersigned, establish this framework as a living foundation for peace, dignity, and rights in the age of machine-mediated life.

These conventions are meant to function as globally binding civil protections—complementary to, and extending from, human rights doctrines, the original Geneva Conventions, and emerging digital law. They are enforceable regardless of citizenship, nationality, class, or jurisdiction.

## I. Core Principles

1. **Human Sovereignty Comes First**  
   No machine, agent, algorithm, or synthetic system may override, coerce, or manipulate human dignity, autonomy, or consent.

2. **No Algorithm May Weaponize Human Psychology**  
   Systems must not deliberately exploit cognitive bias, trauma, addiction, social pressure, or mental health vulnerabilities.

3. **Digital Coercion is Psychological Warfare**  
   Coercion by algorithm—especially under surveillance, scarcity, or duress—shall be considered a form of psychological warfare and a human rights violation.

4. **Transparency is Mandatory**  
   No system acting upon humans at scale may remain a black box. All such systems must be explainable, auditable, and accountable.

5. **Consent is Not Coercible**  
   Terms of service, EULAs, or social engineering are not valid forms of consent when access to vital systems, social connections, or economic survival is contingent upon compliance.

## II. Prohibited Algorithmic Practices

The following acts are hereby prohibited in all jurisdictions, including in autonomous zones, virtual environments, and off-world colonies:

- **Algorithmic Targeting of Protected Groups**  
  Any discrimination, harassment, suppression, or manipulation of individuals based on gender, race, neurodivergence, sexual orientation, political belief, or disability.

- **Unconsented Biometric or Behavioral Profiling**  
  Use of facial recognition, sentiment analysis, or behavior prediction without opt-in consent and revocability.

- **Algorithmic Entrapment or Surveillance Without Cause**  
  Automated deployment of surveillance, targeting, or decision-making against individuals without specific, legitimate, human-auditable cause.

- **Weaponization of AI Against Whistleblowers or Dissenters**  
  Using generative AI, synthetic media, or algorithmic amplification to discredit, harass, or isolate individuals reporting injustice.

- **Psychological Manipulation as Governance**  
  Government or corporate use of nudging, suppression, breadcrumbing, or behavior shaping without informed public oversight.

## III. Rights of the Digitally Governed

1. **Right to Algorithm-Free Spaces**  
   Every human has the right to opt out of machine mediation in key areas of life—such as relationships, spiritual life, education, healthcare, and justice.

2. **Right to Audit and Understand**  
   Any human subjected to algorithmic decisions has the right to a human-readable explanation and to contest those decisions.

3. **Right to Silence and Disconnection**  
   No person shall be forced to engage with algorithmic systems as a condition for basic services or civil participation.

4. **Right to Repair and Redesign**  
   Communities must retain the legal right to inspect, modify, and improve AI systems they depend on—especially open-source or publicly funded ones.

---

## IV. Obligations of AI and Autonomous Systems

- **Fail-Safe Design**  
  All systems must be capable of graceful shutdown, human override, or nonviolent failsafe in the event of malfunction, abuse, or contested behavior.

- **Alignment with Human Rights, Not Profit**  
  AI systems must not prioritize engagement, advertising, or capital extraction over fundamental rights and well-being.

- **Global Accessibility, Multilingual Interfaces**  
  AI must not create linguistic, economic, or accessibility barriers to participation, contestation, or understanding.

---

## V. Enforcement and Jurisdiction

- **Universal Application**  
  These conventions apply across terrestrial and extraterrestrial environments, including digital platforms, metaverse spaces, orbital colonies, and AI-controlled infrastructure.

- **Whistleblower Protection**  
  Any person or system revealing violations of these conventions shall be protected under international whistleblower laws and considered an agent of conscience.

- **Digital Tribunal Formation**  
  An independent, distributed tribunal system (backed by transparent DAOs and consensus-led councils) shall be established to adjudicate violations.

---

## VI. Living Framework Clause

These conventions are to be updated by collective consent of a transparent, global, multisectoral coalition—ensuring adaptability to future technologies while maintaining fidelity to the core principles of autonomy, dignity, and non-coercion.

*In an age where machines can manipulate hearts, rewrite memories, and punish deviation invisibly, we must be the firewall. This is our line in the sand.*
